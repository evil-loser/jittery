//- NOTES -
//- Have removed 'if auth'. We want everyone to see this page, not just signed in users.
//- re: 'if an admin is viewing this page, shouldnt it be 'request.auth.credentials.isAdmin' ??'
//- No, request.auth.isAdmin is only available in node, not in jade templates.
//- If we want to know if someone is an admin, we need to pass it to the template.
//- I intend to add an admin property to the auth variable we're passing in. So auth: {username: '', admin: true}
